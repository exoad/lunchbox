# Code Templates, Snippets, & Single File Libraries

> [!CAUTION]
> This is still WIP.

This repository contains a lot of things where it is very easy to just plop into another project
and inject it directly without having to import it through third party means (e.g. package manager,
downloading and linking). You just copy that single file and slot it in where ever your project is,
maybe having to account for file paths or URIs.

These are here for ease of use and reuse in order to save development time to test out ideas. Once
these templates or whatever has served their purpose, I recommend in my workflow style to opt to
reimplement.
